# 🚀 MERN Stack Project

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **full-stack web application** built using the **MERN Stack** — **MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js**.

The application follows a **client–server architecture**, where:

- The **frontend** is developed using **React.js** with **Material UI** to create a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
- The **backend** is powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, responsible for handling APIs, business logic, and server-side operations.
- **MongoDB** is used as the database to efficiently store and manage application data.

Using the MERN stack allows the entire application to be developed in **JavaScript**, resulting in faster development, better scalability, and easier maintenance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Node.js v16.16.0  
- npm v8.11.0  
- React.js – Frontend library  
- Material UI – UI components and styling  
- Express.js – Backend framework  
- MongoDB – NoSQL database  

---

## ⚙️ Why MERN Stack?

- Single programming language (**JavaScript**) across frontend and backend  
- Faster development using reusable React components  
- Scalable and efficient backend with Node.js and Express  
- Flexible schema design with MongoDB  
- Industry-relevant stack widely used in real-world applications
